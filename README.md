# Kumba_Construction

Kumba Construction, a leading firm in the construction industry, has been at the forefront of
incorporating innovative technologies to streamline its operations and enhance project outcomes.
With a vast array of projects ranging from residential buildings to large infrastructure, the company
generates a significant amount of data from various sources, including project management tools,
financial systems, and client interactions. Recognizing the potential of this data to drive
decision-making and improve efficiency, Kumba Construction has embarked on an initiative to
leverage big data analytics, with a focus on PySpark, to transform its data management and analytical
capabilities.

## Project Involves

### Data Extraction
Extracting data from CSV files into PySpark DataFrames. This involves reading CSV files using
PySpark, which allows for distributed processing of large datasets that traditional data
processing tools cannot handle efficiently.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
Performing data cleaning and transformation using PySpark. This step includes handling
missing values, correcting data types, and transforming data into a suitable format for
analysis. The cleaned and transformed data is then written back into CSV files, leveraging
PySpark's ability to handle distributed data writing.

### Data Loading
Loading the processed CSV files into a PostgreSQL database using Psycopg2. This entails
establishing a connection to the PostgreSQL database from Python, creating the necessary
tables, and efficiently loading data into these tables. This step is crucial for making the
processed data available for advanced analytics, reporting, and data visualization.
